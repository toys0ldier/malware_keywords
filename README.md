# Malware Keywords

This repo contains a list of common malware filenames as derived from [Malshare](https://malshare.com/). The list is compiled daily and represents well over 1 million confirmed malware samples with minimal filtering. Only keywords which have been "seen" at least once in the past 30 days will remain on the list in order to keep it relevent. 

This list is intended for researchers or anyone that needs a list of common naming conventions found in public malware.

I've also included the script used to generate the data, just in case you want to modify my logic in any way.
